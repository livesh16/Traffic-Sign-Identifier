# Traffic-Sign-Identifier
Designed a Convolutional Neural Network to identify 43 different kinds of road signs (stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, etc) in photographs 
using TensorFlow

Converted each image into a NumPy multidimensional array and resized them before passing them into the CNN

Experimented by using different numbers of convolutional layers, pooling layers, filters for convolutional layers, hidden layers and dropout

Developed a neural network capable of correctly identifying traffic signs with an accuracy of 93%
